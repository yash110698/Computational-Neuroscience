# Computational-Neuroscience

### Simulation-of-Neuron-Models

Built computational simulations of numerous single layer neuron models using Python.
- Achieved one of the top grades in class with this project. 

- Simulated a Binary Hopfield network which stores three patterns and evolves in accordance with the McCulloch Pitts formula.
